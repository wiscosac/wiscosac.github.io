## Potential Ideas:
- What routes can a reciever can get the most seperation on dependant on field location (Redzone vs own 5 yrd line)
    - What about seperation?
    - Type of route compared to seperation
        - Focus on handful of routes
- What defender is closest to the targeted reciever, probability of defender changing the play depending on the position they play
    - How does the probability change while the ball is in the air / as they move
    - What defenders are the best at affecting catch probability
    - If he didn't change the play, was there a more optimal path (take into account reorientation)
- How far does a reciever need to be from a defender for a reciever 100% not be touched by the defender
    - How to quantify being touched
        - Find / calculate arm length to create a bubble around each player
        - Does the play end within 5 yards of reception?
- Who was able to put themselves in the right position
    - What is the right position
    - What were they doing
    - Are they in the best spot pre-snap to make a play
- How quickly can defense correct
    - Switching direction
    - Coming back to the ball if they are too deep
    - Using the orientation and speed data
    - Is a saftey switch direction before the ball is thrown to go the right way
    - Data comes from chips in their shoulder pads, be careful using orientation with QB's


## Other Notes:
- Create some visual with each step, not everyone reading your submission with come from a technical background
- Take a "Who is the best corner at this specific thing?" type question and take it a step further
- Use public data with the provided data to help
- Don't end analysis with a list of players that are the best at __
    - Go deeper with its application 
    - Go into an individual play, what is systemic, what is a deviation, what is random ...
- Use the output data in your final metrics / analysis 
- Show what your model is doing on a play, like something that a TV broadcaster could use on the air
- First good step is to reorient the data so it is all going the same way
- Pick one play and build out the response for that one play, then apply it to the dataset
