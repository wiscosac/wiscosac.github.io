You’re probably on this page wondering: “What is sports analytics”. Well, whatever your perception of this field of data analytics is, it only covers the surface of what those who call themselves sports analysts do on a day to day basis. 

Sports analytics, in a general sense, is the process of utilizing statistics in sport to analyze past data and use this to help understand the complexities of sport as well as predict and improve future performance. This can be done on a small, in-game/match level, or on a much larger scale, being used to predict how a team or individual player might do for the entirety of their season.

How does this happen? There are many ways to use data as a quantifier and predictor of sports. One obvious one is statistical analysis and modeling. A common way data gets used to measure skill or ability disparity between teams or players is by selecting one or multiple data elements and using them to compare teams on a table or graph. This is a simple way to visually express what parts of a sport competitors excel at or need work on. Studying these results and analyses helps explain the various hidden contextual factors within sports. 

Now, what do we do on a weekly basis: Well, each week is different! We have workshops, guest speaker events, projects, and other ways to develop the skills of club members. We offer hands-on experience with cutting-edge analytical tools and techniques, allowing members to contribute to real-world projects and gain valuable skills that are increasingly in demand across the sports industry.

If you have any interest in Data Science, Computer Science, Math, or are simply interested in the science behind sports, this is the club for you! Follow our social media’s and keep an eye out for the first meeting of the semester!
