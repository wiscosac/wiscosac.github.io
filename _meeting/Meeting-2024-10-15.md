excerpt: "Big Data Bowl Introduction"

First we introduced the Big Data Bowl theme, Pre-snap to post-snap predictions. Read more about it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2025). We went over [tips](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2025/discussion/539921) given by the NFL for competing. 

We also reviewed [advice](https://x.com/anpatt7/status/1746209633562443948) from last year from Andrew Patton at the NFL about submissions.

#### Big Data Bowl Ideas

- Can we use pre-snap motion to see what routes the offence called

- Analyze how the defense responds to pre-snap motion
