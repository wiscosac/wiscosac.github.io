Our Advisor Sameer Deshpande hosted a talk about the Big Data Bowl. Below are some notes from the meeting.

- What question are you answering and can you explain it in a non technical way.

- Your project should be more of a proof of concept rather than a definitive solution.

- There's a lot of data you don't have to use all of it

- Start with a question and see if the data can answer it not the opposite

- Classify movement and do something with it, draw conclusions and do analysis on it

- Teams are looking to see what they can use in house, explain what your doing and why in your write up

- Voronoi Tessellation - Used to see how pre-snap motion affect how much field each defender is responsible for (can get to that point on the field faster than anyone else)
